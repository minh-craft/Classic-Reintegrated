Q&A:
How did you make this pack?
I worked with side-by-side screenshot comparisons using previous versions of Minecraft to get the best results.

Why is the Nether darker than normal Minecraft?
Pre-Beta 1.8 Nether was darker and more scary. If it is too dark for you, you can adjust the Brightness setting.

Is the water like pre-Beta 1.8 or pre-1.13 (pre-Aquatic Update) in the pack?
The water is the pre-Beta 1.8 water. However, the underwater fog used to be closer and blocks used to be very dark underwater. There is no way around it except changing the code.
If you want the water (between Beta 1.8 and 1.12.2). Just delete the files you don't need (including underwater.json) in the .zip file.

How do I get the Old Night Sky (between Beta 1.5 and 1.2.5)? I prefer when stars are less bright. 
It is included in the pack. Just delete night.png, and rename greystars.png as night.png to use it.

How can I get the sides of the grass block to not be affected by the biome temperature (pre-Beta 1.5)?
It is included in the pack. Go to assets\minecraft\models\block. Delete grass_block.json and rename grass_block_graphics_fast.json as grass_block.json

Can I use your pack for my own ressource pack?
Yes. Please credit me (Sencie) with a link to my pack in your description.
